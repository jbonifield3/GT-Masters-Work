    "A DoE approach would be appropriate for almost any problem in any sphere of life where one wants to determine causation. For example, I have a rather long commute to the office for work every day - an experiment could be designed where I vary the routes I take, the time I leave, how fast I drive, etc to determine how I can get home most quickly."

    "a) An example of data that follows the Binomial distribution is a survey of responses to a yes-no question where the probably of responses is known or can be estimated - In many cases this is true for elections in a two party political system. <br><br>\n",
    "b) Consider a mechanic trying to fix a car, where the chance any given thing he/she tries has a probability <i>p</i> of fixing the issue - a Geometric distribution would model the chance that 3 fixes does not solve the problem <br><br>\n",
    "c) The Poisson distribution is excellent at modeling event occurances over an interval of time - so consider the number of speeding tickets GA state police write every day between 1pm-3pm <br><br>\n",
    "d) The exponential distribution can model the lengths of inter-arrival times between events modeled by the Poisson distribution - so consider the time between each ticket that the GA state police write <br><br>\n",
    "e) Weibull Distributions with a scale parameter $\\lambda$ and shape parameter $k$ can be used to model factors where the probability changes over time, for example $k>1$ indicates that failure rate increases over time. This could be used to model material failure, or potentially certain industrial manufacturing processes.\n"
